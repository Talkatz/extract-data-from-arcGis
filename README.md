# extract-data-from-arcGis
Using arcobjects C# SDK to use the return distance method and populating a dataTable with data from a shape layer

By using arcobjects SDK, we can create buttons and other objects on it, that use the many functions that it provides. 
Also, we can extract data from it for our use outside the ArcMap program. 

Learning how to use arcobjects is to learn how to use it's many classes and interfaces, and how ArcMap is built, or other tools of ArcGis. 
The example here focouses only on two methods of extracting data from a given layer, and not on the full environment in which 
they are needed to be built in, and all of the objects and references that are needed to be created at the beginning.
That information might be added here in the future. 

It can be of use to people that already program with arcobjects. 
The example here we'll be explained in further detail the spatial analysis repository.
